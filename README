README for Subdownloader SVN

    Running

        Whether you want to run in CLI (Command Line Interface) or 
        GUI (Graphical User Interface), the only file you'll need to call is run.py.

        Common example: python run.py --help
        
        
    Problems on first time run

        Is it complaining about 'subdownloader' existance?

        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "run.py", line 40, in <module>
            import gui.main
          File "/path/to/subdownloader-read-only/gui/__init__.py", line 20, in <module>
            from subdownloader import APP_TITLE, APP_VERSION, OSDBServer, subtitlefile, videofile
        ImportError: No module named subdownloader

        You might have to change subdownloader root directory name. 
        If you executed "svn checkout http://subdownloader.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ subdownloader-read-only", do the following:

            * Unix: mv /path/to/subdownloader-read-only /path/to/subdownloader/subdownloader 
            
    Can a read this with some coloring and text format, like a wiki?
